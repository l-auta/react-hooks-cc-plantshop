# Phase 2 Code Challenge: Plantsy Application

## Author: Lisa Auta, 11/09/2024

## Decsription
The project is about an application mainly focused on plants. On the page there is:
- A form for adding a new plant.
- A search bar to search for a specific plant among the ones on the page
- Seven plants, each with their image, names, price and availability displayed.

## Setup

1. Open the directory in which you want to save the repository in.
2. Inside the directory right click and choose **open in terminal** . Once the terminal is open, come back to the github repository.
3. Fork and clone the repository to get a copy in your local machine.
4. Open your text editor, eg **VS Code** and open the built-in terminal
5. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
6. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `6001`.
7. In a new terminal, run `npm start`.
8. Make sure to open [http://localhost:6001/plants](http://localhost:6001/plants)
in the browser to verify that the backend is working before you proceed!

## Endpoints

The base URL for the backend is: `http://localhost:6001`
